# PS1's 2023 FPGA 101

Welcome to our class website. The class happened on 2023/05/27 and went pretty well.

We still have a couple things to fix on that website and the various tools after the feedback from the class:
- Timing explanations, what happens and when
- Ring buffer, some were confused, we probably need an animation or a drawing
- Setting up the lessons, write a file? where? 
- Environments to activate, why an environment
- Different mac addresses and ips. Make a step that tell them exactly what to do. Don't put the same mac on the same network
- ECPDAP not working with --load (khz vs hz in programmer.py of litex) - PR sent https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/pull/1699


You will find all the code, and the source of the website at:
https://github.com/bjonnh/fpga_class_psone/

There is a menu on the left, on a phone you may have to click on the three lines icon.

You'll probably want to start with the [Introduction](./introduction/)

The [Candy jar](candyjar) contains more detailled pages about the subjects discussed in the class.

There are checkmarks next to the pages you visited. You can clear them on the bottom left of the page.

You can change the theme of the website on the bottom left next to the brush. It is not guaranteed to look right if you use a light theme.

The presentation is [HERE](./presentation).
