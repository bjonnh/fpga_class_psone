## Programming

### Faster upload
Programing the ECP5 can be horribly slow with the integrated circuit. 

I recommend something like: https://github.com/phdussud/pico-dirtyJtag with a RP2040 that can program it at high speed. You would have to remove the pogo pins or insulate them and connect the circuit to it.

### Flash, or how to get persistent programs

The colorlight i5 board also contains an SPI EEPROM. This allows you to set a bitstream that will be loaded everytime the board starts instead of having to load it yourself. But it is unfortunately locked when you get it.

You can unprotect the flash with:

```shell
ecpdap flash unprotect
```

And write to the flash

```shell
ecpdap flash write yourfile.bit
```

### If ecpdap doesn't work

There is a program, included in oss-cad that allows to unlock it. Unfortunately, at least on Linux, I had to compile my own with `cargo` the build system for rust. You just have to run


```shell
cargo install ecpdap
~/.cargo/bin/ecpdap scan
```
 
This should reply with something like
```text

```
