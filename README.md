# fpga_class_psone
This repository contains the documentation as well as code/course materials for a class on FPGAs centering around Verilog/Python using the Open Source toolchain and the Colorlite i5 Lattice ECP5 FPGA boards.
The class happened at the Chicago's Hackerspace "Pumping Station: One" on 2023/05/27 and went pretty well for a first one
